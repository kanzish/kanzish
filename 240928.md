# Notes
- 1036 Dang woke up in a GREAT mood today! I'm starting to understand how Seroquel works at least for sleep. I might want to try something a little less...hardcore...but for now this thing is a life saver. Yesterday I had coke zero which has quite a bit of caffiene, and I was also craving weed, and could still sleep. Just gotta keep it going!

I just took out trash, started a chores document. I feel grat and motivated, am gonna do some work so I can eat and possibly get an edible haha
