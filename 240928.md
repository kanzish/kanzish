# Notes
- 1036 Dang woke up in a GREAT mood today! I'm starting to understand how Seroquel works at least for sleep. I might want to try something a little less...hardcore...but for now this thing is a life saver. Yesterday I had coke zero which has quite a bit of caffiene, and I was also craving weed, and could still sleep. Just gotta keep it going!

I just took out trash, started a chores document. I feel grat and motivated, am gonna do some work so I can eat and possibly get an edible haha

- 1532 Just discovered Github Explore...or I should say "rediscovered"! It's super cool and a good way to get into a new language, will need to revist later
- 1758 OK! I'll consider this my "baseline" day. It was pretty good actually, did not mind it one bit. I would prefer to not have to do work-work like Prolific etc, but honestly it seems like I could make $250/mo pretty easily online so I am going to try that
- 1841 I keep forgetting about SSH, I can actually work on this machine from other computers and in some cases it might actually be easier than constantly switching keyboards. My goodness I feel like I had a great day today, even though I didn't even go for a walk
- 2010 Created a Twitter although it's more so I can follow news
- 2205 Heck yes, got llama.cpp working locally! What a milestone, I've been procrastinating on this for so long and it turned out that it was actually kind of simple. I wrote a small guide, so I'm going to post this online (maybe Dev.to or Medium)
