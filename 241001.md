# Notes
- 1012 Whoo! Heck yeah, went to super market and got a few days worth of food, and then went to dispensary and got myself an edible. Also got some coffee! I got to chat with the cute budtender at the dispensary and had a nice 5 min chat, I love talking to her haha. I should be good with food for a few days, just gotta make sure to keep doing working daily and consistently and I should pull up in no time. I want to start investing in electronics and breadboards. I'm so tempted to sell my desktop computer but I have a feeling that the GPU will last me a while with the way LLMs are getting better and better with less and less parameters. I'm so happy haha
