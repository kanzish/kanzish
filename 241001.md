# Notes
- 1012 Whoo! Heck yeah, went to super market and got a few days worth of food, and then went to dispensary and got myself an edible. Also got some coffee! I got to chat with the cute budtender at the dispensary and had a nice 5 min chat, I love talking to her haha. I should be good with food for a few days, just gotta make sure to keep doing working daily and consistently and I should pull up in no time. I want to start investing in electronics and breadboards. I'm so tempted to sell my desktop computer but I have a feeling that the GPU will last me a while with the way LLMs are getting better and better with less and less parameters. I'm so happy haha
- 1025 Got dang I feel good! Having a coffee sure pepped me up haha haven't had one in almost a week
- 1502 Whoo! Fixed my back doing some stretches I found online, it's been bothering me for a few days and I didn't think of just looking up the help haha, this is why I need an active copilot
- 1522 hehe got twitter again so that I can learn in public
