# Notes
- 2308 Whoo! Got Alpine Linux installed on my laptop! I've done this a few times actually but now I'm actually documenting things and with a solid brand. I'm extremely pumped to be diving into a new "lifes work" which is about grokking computer science
- 2334 I had 2 liters of coca cola today, the 2nd time in YEARS...I just never drink soda but I've been watching a Japanese guy going through midlife crisis on youtube (which is very fascinating by the way) and one of the ways he treats himself is by locking himself in a closet to eat chips and drink soda haha so idk that inspired me in some ways. I'm trying to quit chronic drinking and vaping (420). I've made significant progress with vaping to where I just eat edibles a few times a month instead of vaping every day. My highs are significantly higher (to the point of actually being psychedelic not just euphoric) and much much longer...100mg can taken at 10am can keep me feeling loosy goosy right until bedtime.
