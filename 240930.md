# Notes
- 1513 OK! A bit of a late start to taking notes, spent the first part of the day trying to make some cash as I basically ran out of food completely (I have one thing of oat meal that is a year old and 2 bags of broccoli). Fortunately was able to make enough though so I'll be fine for another day or two though it'll be crappy food. I feel utterly motivated though and have actually been laughing and smiling all day even in the face of adversity, so I definitely found my thing! Still need another day or to try and set everything up. I really want to avoid Twitter but man it's such a good place for tech news. Maybe what I could do instead is just set specific times of the day to use Twitter. I basically have to get rid of Reddit because it just makes me seeth and rage at all the humans which at this point are literally lamer than bots haha. I also just finished rearranging my living room so I'm back to using the desktop (was trying to use Alpine Linux in pure terminal mode but it's actually going to take some more work to get there. But we'll get there!
- 1820 Still a bit slow, got distracted with Twitter so I deleted it. It's such a good way to discover content but it's waaaay too distracting. Because what I'm pursuing is so fundamentally new I think I'll just find smaller tighter nit communities
- 1946 Whoooo boy, spent nearly an hour trying to get tmux shortcuts working. Asked my first github question/issue so this is kind of excitign to be talking to others, I'm probably going to go HAM with Github and blogging for now instead of Twitter which honestly is turning to shit
- 2151 Alright! Got Sway window tile manager working and it doesn't even use that much memory which is extremely surprising. I feel like I'm moving a bit slow but rearranging my work environment definitely improved things
