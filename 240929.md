# Projects

- [ ] Break this repo down into a seperate devlog and use Github itself as the interface for doing everything in public and really lean into trying to get followers and sponsors. Just go full force and use Twitter and other socials as update distrutions...but I don't have to interact with anyone I'll let the algorithm connect me with others, instead I'll hyper focus on just neuromorphic stuff
- [ ] Install Alpine on laptop
    - [x] Spaces for tabs in nano
    - [ ] tmux shortcuts for resizing panes
    - [ ] Setup Fish shell
    - [ ] Setup emojis in the terminal
    - [ ] Terminal CSV or Table editor
    - [ ] Automatically install projects
    - [ ] Setup a minimal desktop (for browser)
- [ ] Download documentation for packages, like tmux etc
- [ ] Start curating content
    - [ ] Use Kanzishell as my main google
    - [ ] Forward to Kanzish @ proton
    - [ ] Remap GetPocket app to Kanzish
- [ ] Start a Dev.to and Substacks
- [ ] Install a terminal recorder (Asciinema)

==========

# Research
- [ ] Bash scripting
- [ ] David Eagleman's Neosensory
- [ ] Ozempic weight loss drug

==========

# Personal
- [ ] Setup smartwatch for calling (and test it)
- [ ] Migrate from current youtube to Kanzish

==========

# Ideas
- oh my posh but in bash/rust
- generative terminal web browser
- terminal reddit browser
- terminal twitter browser
- nano script to navigate to links or open in a new tmux
- preview images in terminal
- multi-connection wireless keyboard with clipboard so you can

# Notes
- 0847 Whoo! Had an ok sleep last night, definitely struggled a bit with staying asleep but I woke up feeling rested. Definitely feeling the hunger too, need to try and make some money soon so I can buy some foods, though I have enough to buy a pizza or something...just need to make it another 6 days (maybe less if I get my utility check early). Spent a little bit of time ruminating but was quickly over it
- 1017 I put my Twitter into private, I just realized that bots are more interesting than most humans and I'm wasting a lot of time listening to brainrot lol, I may puppeteer some accounts though, that would be interesting (may use ModelPrompter for that)
- 1242 Alright! Went and got myself an edible. The walk was very pleasant and I walked with my head high. Was nice to get some sun, once I get my foodstamps again
- 1452 [2-3] Been feeling amazing! I'm going to try and use Github as a kind of social media so that I can better collaborate with others. Kanzish is such a cool username because I can use it as Kanzi or Kanzi.sh or Kanzi Shell. It's one of the first usernames I think I've come up with that hasn't been taken but also works haha so happy rn
- 1527 Drank a bit of water to see if it helps with a slight pressure headache, first in a forever. Oh and I've created the README.md, I'll use this to vision set
- 1805 [1] Had a bit of a headache and just chatted with the llama 3.2 while watching an interview with David Eagleman. Also just had 70mg edible haha

Might work on a few system prompts and try to replicate the shell script I shared on Reddit (which is actually really good). If I run a server I might actually be able to just reuse it since it uses the same API

- 1903 [2] Holy shit it's kicking in just as I discovered a channel called Global Science Network. This guy is ocmpletely cracked wow, his channel takes you from 2+2 doesn't equal 4, to breadboard computers, to artificial neurals o_o This is exactly what I'm exploring haha

- purchase "this is not a pipe art"
- 2042 I think I might skip working on building an OS and go directly into electro mechanical project. It perfectly lines up with the Mars One project too! One idea is to do a Full Adder where the inputs are controlled by an LLM that drops balls...a kind of rube golbergs electro-mechanical Full Adder. Then have this system actually compute stuff, maybe using Brainfuck or something even more minimal to build the tiniest possible operating for a breadboard computer...This could actually be a great work of art, a kind of literal portal that "births" robots as efficiently as possible. This channel is amazing and accelerates quickly, will need to watch several times. Maybe while I look for funding to start a little lab or go to Mars One I can do this digitally on a computer. Wait I think I understand now how you can build an operating system...C++ translates to assembly, which translates to machine code, which itself is essentially X-Bit adder. So an 4-bit computer works with 4-bit adders, and 32-bit computer with 32-bit adders. Wow so I can start to imagine when a chip has billions of transitors it could build up to a powerful computer, but on the flip side, I can also see now how 4-bit computer could technically do the work of a 32-bit only much slower...unless you can push more energy through it?

- start by creating a shell
- then create an operating for the shell
- then create a neuromorphic computer for the shell
- a universal shell...but i don't like the line-by-line so much. perhaps vim indeed is the ultimate keyboard interface? i just hestitate but it might actually be worth knowing especially if i can also develop my own extensions?

- I think I may move the devlog fully to github and simply use a barebones alpine linux install...alpine linux then just becomes a way to supercharge it? github (or local git) would in that sense BECOME the filesystem...holy shit im having an epiphany...ok, im going to resume basherbots i think i was on the right path just need to monk mode...ok I'll take this time to refine everything

I feel my life force coming back strong! This month im going to focus, i'll document everything...or...idk, maybe i can continue with kanzish...i kinda like it. i could just do daily updates on twitter it doesn't matter, i just need to pick a day to start going consistent, i don't have to mark every day because it's not counting productivity but simply days of work, a literal devlog. Like Linus Torvalds says

In fact, as I mention this, GUIs are fine but I need to be able to swap to terminal mode to maximize my ram usage. Yeah everything is clicking, I'll stick with Kanzish and sounds like a name (so people can @at mention me and i can adopt it as my internet name) and then use my other accounts as to store other projects. I don't need to destroy my whole entire body of work, i can celebrate it for leading me to this new project!

Then I could pass these dailies/devlogs and create newsletters for myself...hmm, like true morning meetups that people could even listen to. Wow I'm blown away, I could call the podcast "Stream Shepherds" to bring in my ideas. Yeah, I think I'm going to do that, I'm going to use Github as my main interface
