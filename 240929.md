# Notes
- 0847 Whoo! Had an ok sleep last night, definitely struggled a bit with staying asleep but I woke up feeling rested. Definitely feeling the hunger too, need to try and make some money soon so I can buy some foods, though I have enough to buy a pizza or something...just need to make it another 6 days (maybe less if I get my utility check early). Spent a little bit of time ruminating but was quickly over it
- 1017 I put my Twitter into private, I just realized that bots are more interesting than most humans and I'm wasting a lot of time listening to brainrot lol, I may puppeteer some accounts though, that would be interesting (may use ModelPrompter for that)
- 1242 Alright! Went and got myself an edible. The walk was very pleasant and I walked with my head high. Was nice to get some sun, once I get my foodstamps again
